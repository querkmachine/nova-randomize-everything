# Randomize Everything

Randomize Everything is a [Nova](https://nova.app) extension that adds commands to randomly generate strings, numbers, colors and a myriad of other content, which can be pretty handy for placeholder and demo content.

Randomize Everything can currently generate:

- Colors (hexadecimal, RGB, HSL)
- Country names
- Country codes (ISO-3166 alpha-2, alpha-3, numeric)
- Dates, times and datetimes (ISO-8601)
- Lorem Ipsum copy
- Names (first names, last names, full names)
- Numbers (floats and integers)
- Strings (alphabetical, alphanumeric and "password-like")
- UUIDs

## Usage

Search for, install and activate Randomize Everything from Nova's Extension Library (`Extensions -> Extension Library...` or `⇧ + ⌘ + 2`).

Once activated, Randomize Everything can be accessed through the Command Palette (`View -> Command Palette...` or `⇧ + ⌘ + P`) or as an option in the Editor menu (`Editor -> Randomize Everything`).

## Contributing

Whilst basic, this is my first time developing an extension for a code editor. There might be silly mistakes or questionable decisions here and there. Feel free to submit pull requests to fix anything that's obviously off-kilter.

Randomize Everything is tailored to the use cases that I typically need it for. If there's something that can be added that you think would benefit others, feel free to raise an issue to suggest it!

## Thanks

Inspired by, and hat tip to, [random-sublime-text-plugin](https://github.com/kimpettersen/random-sublime-text-plugin) and [nova-uuid](https://github.com/henrikdahl/nova-uuid) for the inspiration and the handy dandy open source code I used to get started.
