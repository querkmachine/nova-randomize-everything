# Randomize Everything

Randomize Everything is a [Nova](https://nova.app) extension that adds commands to randomly generate strings, numbers, colors and a myriad of other content, which can be pretty handy for placeholder and demo content.

Randomize Everything can currently generate:

- Colors (hexadecimal, RGB, HSL)
- Country names
- Country codes (ISO-3166 alpha-2, alpha-3, numeric)
- Dates and datetimes (ISO-8601)
- Names (first names, last names, full names)
- Numbers (floats and integers)
- UUIDs (currently v4 only)

Inspired by, and hat tip to, [random-sublime-text-plugin](https://github.com/kimpettersen/random-sublime-text-plugin) and [nova-uuid](https://github.com/henrikdahl/nova-uuid) for the inspiration and the handy dandy open source code I used to get started.
